        <h4>Fairy</h4>
    <p class="fairy"> 
        Over hill, over dale,<BR>
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,<BR>
        Over park, over pale,<BR>
        Thorough flood, thorough fire,<BR>
        I do wander everywhere,<BR>
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;<BR>
        And I serve the fairy queen,<BR>
        To dew her orbs upon the green.<BR>
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<BR>
        In their gold coats spots you see;<BR>
        Those be rubies, fairy favours,<BR>
        In those freckles live their savours:<BR>
        I must go seek some dewdrops here<BR>
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<BR>
        Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<BR>
        Our queen and all our elves come here anon.<BR>
        </p>
        <h4>PUCK</h4>
    <p class="puck">
        The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<BR>
        Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<BR>
        For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<BR>
        Because that she as her attendant hath<BR>
        A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<BR>
        She never had so sweet a changeling;<BR>
        And jealous Oberon would have the child<BR>
        Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<BR>
        But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<BR>
        Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<BR>
        And now they never meet in grove or green,<BR>
        By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<BR>
        But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<BR>
        Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</p>
